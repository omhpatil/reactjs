npx create-react-app 01reactjs : creating react project using the npm(node package exeute)

| Part               | Meaning                                                                  |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `npx`              | Runs a package without installing it globally (just temporary use).      |
| `create-react-app` | A tool that sets up a new React project with all files and dependencies. |
| `01reactjs`        | The name of the folder (and project) that will be created.               |

another way to create react project:
- npm create vite@latest 01vitereact
- then go inside the 01vitereact: cd 01vitereact
- then run one command to get node module folder: npm install

++ vitereact is little faster than the react which is using the npx ++

***

to start project: always use {npm run start}
it will render to: http://localhost:3000/

if run by using {npm run dev}
it will render to: http://localhost:5173/

- React Fragments	: In React, Fragments let you group multiple elements without adding extra HTML nodes (like a <div>) to the DOM.
- Why we use : Normally, if you return more than one element in a component, React needs them to be wrapped in a single parent.

used div tag here:		used <> blank tag instead of div:	
return (				return (
  <div>					  <>
    <h1>Hello</h1>			     <h1>Hello</h1>
    <p>Welcome</p>			     <p>Welcome</p>
  </div>				  </>
);					);

***

- Things to kept in mind while coding in react: Function name should start with Capital letter and use fragements to write more components.
- while coding inside vite file extension should be .jsx also in react you can use both .js and .jsx also
